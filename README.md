**Authors:** Atlanta Liu, Greg Cameron, Maruthi Mutnuri, Edwin Aguirre

**Date:** Fall 2020

A 30 minute presentation on Apache Spark with an interactive component for the class to participate in. The goal is to clearly communicate the significance, theoretical underpinnings, as well as the practical applications of the topic. Below are some of the questions we aimed to address through our presentation:

- Why is this topic important and what kind of problems does it aim to solve?
- How does this technology work and who is it designed for?
- What are some examples of real-world applications? 

There is also a technical demonstration in Jupyter notebook of Spark Streaming in action.
