### What's in this repository?

This repository contains a 30 minute presentation on Apache Spark with an interactive component for the class to participate in. The goal is to clearly communicate the significance, theoretical underpinnings, as well as the practical applications of the topic. Below are some of the questions we aimed to address through our presentation:

- Why is this topic important and what kind of problems does it aim to solve?
- How does this technology work and who is it designed for?
- What are some examples of real-world applications? 

Attached to this repository is also an example of Spark SQL and Spark RDDs (Resilient Distributed Dataframes) in demonstration. The code for Spark instantiation simply allows us to connect to the University of Calgary network to run the program.
